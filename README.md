## Introduction to the Mint platform and its philosophy

Mint is a live tracking platform for endurance race athletes, designed for everyone from beginners to professionals.

Through this platform, we aim to achieve several goals, including:

### `Encouraging more people to run`

I had been running for some time, but I only started registering for races/marathons/trails a few months ago. I must say I regret not doing it earlier. I’ve met and cheered for people of all backgrounds and profiles. What they all had in common was a smile and a great attitude, whether you knew them or not.

Running a marathon isn’t so much about finishing at the top of the leaderboard—it's about the pride of completing it. The only competitor I run against is my personal best.

I’m convinced many people don’t realize how much running can bring them—both physically and mentally. This is the first and most important goal we must keep in mind throughout the project and its evolution.

### `Highlighting lesser-known races`

To achieve the previous goal, discovering races must be as simple as possible. It’s easier (especially for a beginner) to join a race happening nearby than to travel far for it.

Many great races are organized without enough visibility and are easily overlooked by runners who would have signed up if they knew about them. We want to make it easier to discover races happening near you.

### `Encouraging runners to participate in more events`

Closely related to the previous goal, joining a race is more than a physical challenge: it’s about exploring new regions and meeting new people—something we want to encourage.

### `Encouraging spectators to run with their loved ones`

Last but not least: running is also a great way to spend time with loved ones and push limits together. Mint aims to encourage those still hesitant to take that first step, whether it’s for a 5K or an ultra.

> [!NOTE]
> Mint’s goal is not (and never will be) to replace traditional timing systems (like [Chrono-Course](https://www.chrono-course.com/) in France), which focus on performance for the athlete.  
> Mint focuses on the athlete’s pre- and post-race experience, but above all, on the spectator’s experience during the race.

## Project Context and Definition

The project was proposed by me (Charles Chrismann). To understand it fully, it helps to know a bit more about me and the motivations behind it:

I practice road running and trail running—both endurance sports.

Running has been a life-changing discovery for me, altering my personality and habits. This project is part of my desire to encourage more people to start running.

### Observations

My family and friends are my biggest supporters, and I want to give them a better way to watch and follow my races.

They can’t always be there on race day, and even if they are, they only see me for a few seconds as I pass.

> [!NOTE]
> Some races are broadcasted, but only major ones (by participant numbers), and coverage often focuses on the lead runners. Most races don’t have the means to film the event.

Currently, when I run a race and want to keep my loved ones updated, I use the beacon feature on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/), which is really meant for safety.

It only shares my location—no course route, no position, no ranking. It doesn’t reflect the race atmosphere.

### The Idea

To improve spectator experience, the idea is to offer an app that participants install on their phone (ideally all, but it works even if only some do). It would track and send their live location.

Spectators would access a map interface showing the race route, live runner locations, highlights of runners they support, and their approximate ranking.

Runner positions and rankings would be updated in real-time, offering a viewing experience closer to that of a televised event.

The app is especially suited for endurance formats: marathons, trail/ultras, cycling, and duathlon.

### Features

The app will offer several features for runners, spectators, and organizers:

- [x] A calendar of past and upcoming races
- [x] Ability to replay any race
- [x] Ability to browse nearby races: happening now, upcoming, or open for registration
- [x] Athletes can log their gear and add sponsors (for pro/semi-pro runners)
- [x] Race organizers can register their events with all details: distances, dates, mandatory gear, regulations, etc.

### Future Ideas

To further immerse spectators, the next step could be to allow runners to stream their race live via action cams, offering a first-person view.

Other ideas include smart camera switching, showing the appropriate fixed cameras as the tracked runner passes by.

We’re also considering a virtual locker room—a 3D room in the app where runners can view their past race rewards: bibs, medals, t-shirts, etc.

A tool to help find close other runners for carpooling.

A map of close events, today, in the next days, events with remaining places.

## Challenges

We’re aware that the project will face several obstacles, and we’re actively exploring solutions.  
**Questions and suggestions are always welcome.**

- Not all runners carry their phone  
  > A common concern—and it’s true. We’re looking for data on how many runners carry their phone during races.  
  > Many runners listen to music using devices like [Shokz](https://shokz.com), meaning they do carry a phone.  
  > Some formats like trail running even require carrying a phone for safety.  
  > The goal is to give an approximation of the race layout. Even if not everyone uses the app, those who do help show group sizes. With the number of app users and race participants, we can estimate total runners—though this can introduce bias (e.g. elite runners are less likely to carry a phone).

- Some areas lack 4G coverage  
  > In France, coverage has improved greatly since 2015. See the [ARCEP](https://www.arcep.fr) report [here (FR)](../documents/04-24-version-francaise.pdf).  
  > [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com) seems promising for this, but is not yet widespread in France.

- Some devices have poor location accuracy

- The app may drain the phone’s battery

## Surveys

In order to create a meaningful product, we need to understand the needs of each user — whether they are spectators, runners, race organizers, or sponsors. To that end, we need as much feedback as possible.

The different surveys are listed below — if you know someone whose input could help us, please feel free to share the links with them. Thank you in advance!

If you have any suggestions to improve the surveys, don’t hesitate to reach out at contact.mint.running@gmail.com.

## Acknowledgements

Because Mint focuses on endurance races, gathering insights directly from those who participate in such events is essential. We reached out to runners, trail runners, and triathletes to better understand their needs and expectations. Some generously agreed to share their thoughts and feedback.

To respect everyone’s privacy, we’ve asked each person whether they’d like to be credited here. Whether they chose to be named or remain anonymous, we are extremely grateful for their time and support, Mint wouldn't be the same without them.

They kindly agreed to answer our surveys:
