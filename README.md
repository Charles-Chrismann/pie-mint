## Context and Project Definition

The project was proposed by myself (Charles Chrismann). To fully understand it, it's useful to know a bit more about me and what motivated the idea:

I practice road running and trail running—both endurance sports.

Running has been a personal discovery for me, to the point where it changed my personality and habits. This project is part of my desire to encourage people to start running.

### The Issue

My friends and family are my biggest supporters, and I’d like to return the favor by providing them with a better spectator experience.

They can't always be there on race day, and even when they are, they only get to see me briefly as I pass by.

> [!NOTE]
> Some races are covered by media, but only the most popular ones. Even then, the coverage usually focuses on the race leaders. The vast majority of events don’t have the resources to be filmed.

Right now, when I race and want to keep my loved ones informed of my progress, I use the beacon feature in [Strava](https://www.strava.com/), originally designed for runner safety.

This solution only shows my location—no race route, no ranking, no context. It doesn’t capture the excitement of a real race.

### The Idea

To improve the spectator experience, the idea is an app that participants would have on their phones (ideally all, but it works even with only some). It tracks and sends their live location.

On the spectator’s side, they access a map-based interface showing the race route and all runners’ positions in real time. The runner they support is highlighted, and their approximate ranking is displayed.

The race positions and rankings update live, providing an experience closer to watching a televised event.

This concept fits endurance races well: marathons, trail/ultras, triathlons, and ironmans.

### Future Evolution

To further immerse the spectator, the next step would be for runners to stream their races live through action cameras attached to them—offering a runner’s point of view.

Other ideas include:
- Using fixed cameras along the race route to auto-switch to views relevant to the tracked runner.
- A virtual locker room: a 3D space in the app where runners can view race souvenirs like past bibs, medals, and t-shirts.

## Challenges

We’re aware of several obstacles—some obvious, some less so—and are actively exploring solutions. **Questions and suggestions are always welcome.**

- Not all runners carry their phones.
  > This was one of the first concerns raised, and it’s valid. We’re looking into stats on how many runners race with their phones.
  
  > Many runners listen to music via gear like [Shokz](https://shokz.com), which requires carrying a phone.
  
  > In trail races, phones are often mandatory for safety.
  
  > Even if not everyone is equipped, we can still approximate the race flow. If we know how many runners are on the app and how many are in the race, we can extrapolate the overall race shape. Note: this can introduce bias, as professional runners are less likely to carry phones.

- Some areas have poor 4G coverage.
  > Since 2015, France’s network coverage has greatly improved (see the [ARCEP](https://www.arcep.fr) study [here (fr)](../documents/04-24-version-francaise.pdf)).
  
  > [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com) could be a promising solution, though still early in adoption—at least in France.

- Device location accuracy can vary.

- The app could drain the phone’s battery.

## Competitors

Some existing apps offer similar features, but they are often designed for a single event (e.g. New York Road Runners), or require spectators to manually input runner IDs with a limited number of follow slots.
